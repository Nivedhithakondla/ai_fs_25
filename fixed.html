            The first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.[15][16] He then recruited Nicola Pellow to write the Line Mode Browser, 
            which displayed web pages on dumb terminals.[17] The Mosaic web browser was released in April 1993, and was later credited as the first web browser to find mainstream popularity.[18][19] Its innovative graphical user interface made the World Wide Web easy to navigate and thus more accessible to the average person. This, in turn, sparked the Internet boom of the 1990s, when the Web grew at a very rapid rate.[19] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released the Mosaic-influenced Netscape Navigator in 1994. Navigator quickly became the most popular browser.[20]

            Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. Within a few years, Microsoft gained a dominant position in the browser market for two reasons: it bundled Internet Explorer with its popular Windows operating system and did so as freeware with no restrictions on usage. The market share of Internet Explorer peaked at over 95% in the early 2000s.[21] In 1998, Netscape launched what would become the Mozilla Foundation to create a new browser using the open-source software model. This work evolved into the Firefox browser, first released by Mozilla in 2004. Firefox's market share peaked at 32% in 2010.[22] Apple released its Safari browser in 2003; it remains the dominant browser on Apple devices, though it did not become popular elsewhere.[23]
            Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, which steadily took market share from Internet Explorer and became the most popular browser in 2012.[24][25] Chrome has remained dominant ever since.[1] In 2015, Microsoft replaced Internet Explorer with Edge [Legacy] for the Windows 10 release.[26] In 2020, this legacy version was replaced by a new Chromium-based version of Edge.

            Since the early 2000s, browsers have greatly expanded their HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and multimedia capabilities. One reason has been to enable more sophisticated websites, such as web apps. Another factor is the significant increase of broadband connectivity in many parts of the world, enabling people to access data-intensive content, such as streaming HD video on YouTube, that was not possible during the era of dial-up modems.[27]
